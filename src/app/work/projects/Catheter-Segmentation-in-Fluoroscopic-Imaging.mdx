## Overview

The project focused on enhancing the accuracy and robustness of catheter detection in real-time interventional procedures. I explored various convolutional neural network architectures, optimized model performance, and validated results on clinical imaging datasets to support safe and efficient navigation during minimally invasive surgeries.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyse the dataset for Missing values & Outliers.
- **Visualization**: Visualize trends on monthly and yearly basis.
- **Transformation & Imputation**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Feature Creation**: Creating new features that may improve model accuracy.
- **Data Sourcing**: Sourcing 3rd party data that may improve our dataset.
- **Model Creation**: Creating a LSTM model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For analysis, visualization and model creation.
- **Philips annotation tool**: For data annotation.
- **AWS**: For model deployment. 

## Challenges and Learnings

This project aimed to predict vegetation health in Marsabit, Kenya using satellite (NDVI), weather, and agricultural data. One of the main challenges was dealing with outliers in the data and slight skewness in some variables, which made analysis more complex. Another issue was that agricultural data was only available for a short time, limiting how much it could contribute to the model. While the model performed very well, the low error rates raised concerns about possible overfitting. It was also a bit tricky to combine and align data from different sources and timeframes.

## Outcome

Despite these challenges, the team learned a lot. Creating new features like NDVI Anomaly and Rate of Change helped capture meaningful patterns in vegetation health. It also became clear that soil moisture had a bigger effect on vegetation than weather conditions. Using a simpler model (Random Forest) before training the LSTM helped identify which data points were most useful. Transfer learning—retraining the model with a smaller, more focused dataset—gave even better results, reducing prediction errors significantly.

In the end, the project successfully built a strong model that can predict vegetation health with high accuracy. It also showed how important good data and smart feature design are when using machine learning for environmental problems. Going forward, collecting more long-term data and testing the model in real-world conditions would be useful steps.
